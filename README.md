Implementation of Automated Gaussian spectral clustering of hyperspectral data (https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/conference-proceedings-of-spie/4725/1/Automated-Gaussian-spectral-clustering-of-hyperspectral-data/10.1117/12.478758.short)

data_handling.py: Functions to load in and pre-process hyperspectral data from AVIRIS and ARCHER sources
utils.py: Various machine learning and helper functions used that aren't exactly part of Gaussian spectral clustering
gaussian_spectral_clustering.py: Contains the code that implements the functional blocks from the paper

gaussian-spectral-clustering-[ARCHER/AVIRIS].ipynb: Python notebooks implementing the "main" and demonstrating how to use the codebase/generate results for ARCHER and AVIRIS data
